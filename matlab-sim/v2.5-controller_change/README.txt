WHAT IS IMPLEMENTED IN THIS VERSION?
>Body elements are imported.
>Actuator model is not yet implemented - there is no compliance between motor output and module output. 
>Controller outputs direct torques (no implementation of strategies like in - https://docs.hebi.us/core_concepts.html#gain-tuning - under strategy control)

WHAT SHOULD THIS MODEL BE USED FOR?
>First and foremost to test the basic control algorithms.
